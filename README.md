# Codes:
•	Output_EDUC.m : extract/calculate output from deterministic SCED (single profile)
•	Output_EDUC_multiple.m : extract/calculate average output from deterministic SCEDs (multiple profiles)
•	Output_SCED_StocSCUC.m : extract/calculate average output from deterministic SCEDs (multiple profiles) using Stochastic SCUC’s decisions
•	Vresinputs.m : calculate transition matrices
•	Settransmatsh.m and setprofinfosh are supplementary files required to calculate the transition matrices and profiles 
•	Scucfr_ny22sh.m : Run Deterministic SCUC
•	Stoc_SCUC.m : Run Stochastic SCUC 
•	Scedfr_j_ny22sh.m : Run SCED for multiple profiles with deterministic/stochastic SCUC’s decisions
